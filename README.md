# Global Health Early Warning System (GHEWS)

Revolutionizing pandemic detection through emotional arc analysis and multi-agent AI. GHEWS detects potential health crises by analyzing sentiment patterns and communication trajectories across cultures and languages - identifying threats before traditional metrics show danger signals. 

Our system learns from historical crisis patterns while continuously monitoring global communications, integrating WHO guidelines and Berlin Call principles to enable truly proactive health crisis prevention.

## üåç Overview

GHEWS introduces a paradigm shift in global health surveillance by:
- Detecting early pandemic signals through emotional arc analysis
- Learning from historical sentiment patterns in past health crises
- Analyzing cross-cultural communication patterns in real-time
- Correlating emotional indicators with traditional health metrics
- Providing culturally-aware risk assessment based on regional sentiment analysis
