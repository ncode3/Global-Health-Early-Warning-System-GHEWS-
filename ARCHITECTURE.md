# GHEWS Architecture: Early Warning Through Communication Analysis

## Core Innovation

GHEWS introduces a new approach to pandemic detection by analyzing changes in communication patterns. Our hypothesis is that subtle shifts in how healthcare workers, communities, and officials communicate could indicate emerging health concerns before they become apparent through traditional metrics.

### Pattern Recognition System
- Analyzes communications in major world languages
- Compares current patterns against historical data
- Identifies potential anomalies in communication flows
- Learns from validated patterns

### Key Indicators We Monitor
1. **Healthcare Communication**
   - Changes in professional medical discussions
   - Shifts in terminology usage
   - Communication frequency changes

2. **Community Signals**
   - Social media sentiment changes
   - Public health discussions
   - Local concern patterns

3. **Regional Variations**
   - Cultural communication differences
   - Language-specific patterns
   - Regional response variations

## Technical Foundation
